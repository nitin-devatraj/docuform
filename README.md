# docuform

docuform is just a simple app that displays a form to fetch user input like name, email, etc and validate it. this app was built to practise working with forms,  fetching user input & validation logic that is common when working with forms. it even uses a custom hook called useInput that encapsulates the state, event handler functions, and other logic that every form input needs.
